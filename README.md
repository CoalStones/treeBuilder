# treeBuilder
This java program takes in a string then creates a simple tree out of it 
It starts with the first character of the word, then the first and second followed by the first then the first second and third followed by the second and first and so fourth
It ends with the stem being the entire word

For example the word "word" would look like this

   w
  wow
 worow
wordrow
 worow
  wow
   w
   o
   r
   d
